# Changelog

All notable changes to Tink are tracked here.

Tink is pre-v1. Expect small, reviewable changes until the v1.0.0 hardening gates pass.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `/tink:update` slash command: detects install source, diagnoses user-modified files, and shows the safe update command.
- `npx tink-harness update` subcommand: data-preserving update that keeps user-modified files. Use `--force` to overwrite everything (data loss risk).

### Changed

- README Update section now recommends `npx ... update` only. The `install --force` path is no longer documented as a user-facing option (the `--force` flag remains in the code for emergency use but is not advertised).

### Planned (v1.1)

- Layered scope model: merge `global` (`~/.tink/`) + `repo` (`.tink/`) + `local` (`.tink/local/` or `.tink/settings.local.json`) following the Claude Code settings pattern. Tracked separately.


## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Restored the README hero image after the previous fix targeted the wrong surface.
- Increased the installer TINK banner contrast for dark terminal themes.


## [0.1.3]

Skipped during pre-v1 sequencing.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- Added a synthesis probe so `/tink:cast` can detect when a built-in harness is only a generic fit.
- Made run-only draft harnesses the default path for generic-fit cases, with saving still requiring separate approval.
- Clarified that `harness-synthesis` should handle both `no fit` and `generic fit` cases.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Existing-user update instructions for Claude Code plugin installs.
- Standalone compatibility installer refresh command using `--force`.
- Maintenance evidence structure: approval ledger and weave queue templates.
- Run record fields for selected, rejected, actually loaded, and maintenance evidence.

### Changed

- Bumped the Claude Code plugin version to make `/plugin update` detect the latest release.
- Clarified `unknown` evidence handling for `/tink:list`.
- Added evidence grades for `/tink:frog` and evidence handles for `/tink:weave`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Initial pre-v1 plugin shape for Tink.
- Plugin-first `/tink:*` command surface.
- Standalone compatibility installer.
- Built-in harnesses, setup flow, optional hook recommendation, and visible `.tink/` state model.
